How to start the program:
The program runs with exactly 3 nodes. In 3 separate consoles placed in the directory of the repository, write "Go run main.go 0", "Go run main.go 1" and "Go run main.go 2".
The argument after tells the peer being started which id it has, that being 5000, 5001, 5002. 
This should show tge logs both in the console as well as the "Logs.txt" file, as well as print the work being done in the critical section in the "CriticalSection.txt" file.
